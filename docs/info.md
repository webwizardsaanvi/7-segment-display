## How it works

Basically, it uses a bunch of inverters, and, and or gates to make a seven segment display work! :D

## How to test

The project can be tested using the first 4 inputs, with them represening an ABCD input, which would translate to a 4 bit binary output, that when converted ot a decimal value, would be the value displayed on the seven segment display!

## External hardware

Nothing really! I mean there's a seven segment display! :)
